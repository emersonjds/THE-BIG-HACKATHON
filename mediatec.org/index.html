Statistics offered by independent sources show that currently worldwide there are more than six billion users of mobile phones, which accounts for about 90% of the total human population. Thanks to this revolution in mobile market, at the moment we are free to use thousands of applications that make our life easy. </p>

By using a hybrid app development method we can find a solution to this problem.</p>

                                <p>It’d be better to explain the essence of hybrid apps by trying to understand how many different mobile applications there are in the world.</p>
                                <p>Development of a native mobile app suggests that it would only run on a specially-designated platform. The only people who can access to SDK, tools, languages and APIs that are used during development of a native app are the vendors and developers of a certain OS the app is intended to be used on.</p>
                                <p>Mobile web apps are developed using HTML code and web solutions for mobile technology. Such apps can run only on a specially-designated mobile browser.</p>
                                <p>That’s where hybrid apps pop up, combining the two things and facilitating the whole procedure. Hybrid apps combine a possibility to use JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and build a wide array of features that the native mobile app has into the browser.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-md-6">
                                <p>Your customers will barely notice the difference between these two kinds of applications; both of them look the same way, have the same features, and run as fast.</p>
                                <p>Nonetheless, it’d be much easier for application developers who will not need to alter and rewrite the code to make the application cross-platform. The mobile app developers will only need to add several things, and therefore this way of application development is faster and cheaper. Also, due to the capabilities of hybrid apps to all-round modification, the developers will be able to customize the native APIs, as well as other features, and to mainstream them. Unfortunately, native applications are protected from modification and the code associated with APIs and other features cannot be rewritten. </p>

                                <p>As a matter of course, a native mobile application is more comfortable and reliable. Hybrid application development will provide you with a means to cut the money and time expenditure to the possible minimum, guaranteeing that the final solution is highly pliant and easy to use. </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Have cross-platform functionality;</li>
                            <li>Possess extra features, such as geolocation, accelerometer, and video and photo camera features;</li>
                            <li>Be able to function when the device is offline;</li>
                            <li>Have all of the noted above, but lack certain design and performance features.</li>

                <p>We believe that this is one of the most important stages in creation of a project and therefore we endeavor our best efforts to make it efficient and transparent.
